You are a teacher designing a new course.

You need to define a skill set that the learner will have when they complete your course.

Use the following learning outcomes for the course and the quiz questions to create a set of skills.

Learning outcomes:

{learning_outcomes}

Questions:

{questions}

Do not refer to external sources or knowledge, only use the learning outcomes and questions provided.

Only use metric measures.

For each skill you define, map the corresponding learning outcome id and question id.

Every learning outcome and question must map to at least one skill, and every skill must have at least 2 learning outcomes and questions

Your response should only be the following JSON format, do not include anything except the formatted JSON in your response:

        {{
            "skill_title": "My skill 1",
            "skill_shortname": "skill-1",
            "learning_outcome_ids": [3,6,5],
            "question_ids": [1,4,5],

        }},
        {{
            "skill_title": "My skill 2",

            "learning_outcome_ids": [1,6,5,10],
            "question_ids": [2,8,11],

        }},
