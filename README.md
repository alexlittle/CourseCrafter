CourseCrafter
================

A prototype application to use AI tools to build a structured course outline from a provided set of resources.

Background
---------------

My idea for building this came from me desire to learn about how AI can be used in education in an appropriate way. 
It's also my first application built using technologies such as Ollama and LangChain, so I'm using this as a way to help 
me learn these tools. For sure, I will not have done everything in the best way, so would welcome any feedback (or PRs!)

Assumptions/Limitations
------------------------
This could be a long list, but I'll stick to the basics...

* It's built to be able to run locally on a PC/laptop, which means that only small LLMs can be run, and it'll be quite 
  slow
* It's designed to support teachers/tutors who already have some course resources, but who would like some ideas on how 
  these resources could be put together to form a complete course outline

Technologies Used
-------------------

* Ollama
* LangChain
* Chroma (Vector Store)
* Django
